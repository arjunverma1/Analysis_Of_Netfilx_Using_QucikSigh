Setting Up Amazon QuickSight:

The first step involved creating a QuickSight account, which is a free process.
The project required enabling QuickSight's access to Amazon S3, where the dataset was stored. This step was crucial for QuickSight to process the data.
Uploading Files to Amazon S3:

The dataset and a manifest.json file were uploaded to an S3 bucket.
The manifest.json file was edited to include the correct S3 URL, ensuring that QuickSight could locate and use the dataset correctly.
Connecting S3 to QuickSight:

The S3 bucket was connected to QuickSight, and the dataset was imported by specifying the S3 bucket details in the QuickSight interface.
The manifest.json file played a vital role in this step by providing the correct path to the dataset.
Creating Visualizations:

The visualizations were created by dragging relevant fields into the QuickSight dashboard's Autograph space.
An example provided is a graph showing the breakdown of release years, where the release year was placed on the Y-axis, and the type (movie or TV show) was the grouping variable.
Using Filters:

Filters were applied to the visualizations to sort the data according to specific criteria.
One visualization included a filter that excluded TV shows and movies added after 2015, focusing on content released before 2015.
Setting Up a Dashboard:

The final touch involved setting up a dashboard with clear titles for each graph to make the purpose of each chart evident to the viewer.
The dashboard was published, and it could be exported as a PDF.
Challenges:

The project highlighted the ease of understanding graphs and charts in QuickSight.
One unexpected challenge was ensuring the correct S3 URL was set in the manifest.json file, as an incorrect URL would lead to errors.
Duration:
The entire project took approximately 40-60 minutes to complete.

Key Tools Used:

Amazon QuickSight: For data visualization.
Amazon S3: For storing the dataset and manifest.json file.
